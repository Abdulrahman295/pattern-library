# Facade Design Pattern
The facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that enables users to construct an easy-to-use interface by concealing the complex implementation details of the system (Poorte, 2023). The goal of this pattern is to hide the implementation details from users and provide a uniform, simplified interface for a collection of interfaces, making them easier to use (GeeksforGeeks, 2023).

## Uses of Facade Design Pattern
1. Facade offers a higher-level interface, which makes interacting with complex subsystems easier.
2. Facade serves as an API between the presentation layer and service layer in multi-layer web applications, concealing the complex nature of business objects and interactions.
3. Facade can be used to modify complicated or confusing legacy code by hiding its complexities behind a simpler interface, making it simpler for clients to work with.
4. Facade is frequently used with other design patterns, such as Singleton or Factory, to improve usability and provide a consistent interface for client interaction.
(Poorte, 2023)

The elements that are involved in the Facade design pattern are:
1. Subsystem: The entire intricate logic and implementation are handled by a class, collection of classes, or interfaces that make up the Subsystem.
2. Facade: The class or object that acts as a doorway into the Subsystem's implementation while concealing its complex details of its implementation.
3. Client: The Client uses the streamlined Facade Interface for performing operations without being aware of the specifics of the internal implementation.
(GeeksforGeeks, 2023)

## Example demonstrating the Facade Method pattern in JavaScript:

### Step 1: Creation of Subsystem

In JavaScript, we first define classes representing different subsystems. Each class encapsulates functionality related to a specific aspect of the system:

``` javascript
// Define a class for SoftwareDeveloper
class SoftwareDeveloper {
    // Define a method within the SoftwareDeveloper class to represent coding
    code() {
      console.log('Software Developer codes the frontend and backend for an application');
    }
}

// Define a class for Designer
class Designer {
    // Define a method within the Designer class to represent designing
    design() {
      console.log('UI Designer creates the wireframes for the website.');
    }
}

// Define a class for DatabaseEngineer
class DatabaseEngineer {
    // Define a method within the DatabaseEngineer class to represent connecting
    connect() {
      console.log('Database engineer performs the connection between the application and the database.');
    }
}
```

We have three classes here: `SoftwareDeveloper`, `Designer`, and `DatabaseEngineer`, each of which represents a subsystem responsible for a specific task in the software development process. The `SoftwareDeveloper` class's `code()` method takes handle of coding activities, the `Designer` class's `design()` method takes responsibility of designing tasks, and the `DatabaseEngineer` class's `connect()` method takes charge of database connection tasks. Each subsystem's behavior is specified by these classes.

### Step 2: Creation of the Facade

The `SoftwareFacade` class, which serves as a simplified interface to manage the software development process, is created in this stage. Instances of the classes  `SoftwareDeveloper`, `Designer`, and `DatabaseEngineer` are initialized by the constructor. These subsystems are controlled by the `softwareDevelopmentProcess()` method, which calls particular `code`, `design`, and `connect` methods, respectively. The client's interaction is made simpler by this encapsulation, which conceals the complexity of various subsystems behind a single facade interface.

``` javascript
// Define a class for SoftwareFacade
class SoftwareFacade {
    // Constructor function to initialize instances of SoftwareDeveloper, Designer, and DatabaseEngineer classes
    constructor() {
        this.softwareDeveloper = new SoftwareDeveloper(); // Initialize instance of SoftwareDeveloper class
        this.uiDesigner = new Designer(); // Initialize instance of Designer class
        this.databaseEngineer = new DatabaseEngineer(); // Initialize instance of DatabaseEngineer class
    }

    // Method to represent the software development process, coordinating actions of SoftwareDeveloper, Designer, and DatabaseEngineer
    softwareDevelopmentProcess() {
        this.softwareDeveloper.code(); // Call the code method of SoftwareDeveloper
        this.uiDesigner.design(); // Call the design method of Designer
        this.databaseEngineer.connect(); // Call the connect method of DatabaseEngineer
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Usage and the Client code

A new instance of `SoftwareFacade` named `softwareFacade` is created by this line of code. Next, it calls the `softwareDevelopmentProcess()` function of the `softwareFacade` instance to start the software development process. The facade pattern provides a single interface that makes it easier to work with the `SoftwareDeveloper`, `Designer`, and `DatabaseEngineer` subsystems. This method coordinates the actions of these subsystems.

```Javascript
// Create an instance of the SoftwareFacade class
const softwareFacade = new SoftwareFacade();

// Call the softwareDevelopmentProcess method of the softwareFacade instance, initiating the software development process
softwareFacade.softwareDevelopmentProcess();

```

### Output

```
Software Developer codes the frontend and backend for an application
UI Designer creates the wireframes for the website.
Database engineer performs the connection between the application and the database
```
