### ISSUE: Add React Native implementation for Singleton pattern #8

React Native is a framework created by Facebook that empowers developers to construct mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It facilitates the development of cross-platform mobile applications compatible with both iOS and Android platforms, utilizing a unified codebase. By rendering native user interface components, React Native ensures that the resulting applications exhibit the appearance and behavior of native apps, while enabling code sharing across platforms. This approach simplifies development, enhances performance, and promotes code maintainability.

Now, let's discuss how to use a Singleton pattern in a React Native application:

- Create the Singleton Class: Define your Singleton class, which will manage shared state or provide access to a shared resource. This class should have a static instance property to hold the single instance of the class.

- Implement the Singleton Logic: Within the Singleton class constructor, check if an instance already exists. If it does, return the existing instance; otherwise, create a new instance and store it in the static instance property.

- Use the Singleton in React Native Components: In your React Native components, you can access the Singleton instance using its static getter method (Singleton.instance). You can then use this instance to access shared state or perform operations provided by the Singleton.

- Update and Retrieve Singleton State: React Native components can interact with the Singleton instance by calling its methods to update or retrieve its state. This allows components to share data and communicate with each other through the Singleton.

# React Native Singleton Pattern Implementation

This implementation of the Singleton pattern in React Native provides a structured approach to manage shared state across multiple components within a React Native application.

## Components

### Static Instance Variable (`instance`):

A private static variable that holds the single instance of the class. This ensures that there is only one instance of the Singleton class throughout the application.

### Constructor:

Checks if an instance already exists by examining `instance`. If it exists, the constructor returns the existing instance instead of creating a new one. If it doesn't exist, the constructor initializes the class's state and assigns the newly created instance to `instance`.

### Static Getter (`getInstance`):

A static method that provides global access to the Singleton instance. It creates the instance if it doesn't exist and returns the existing instance if it does.

### State Management (`getState` and `setState`):

Methods to get the current state and update the state of the Singleton, respectively. `setState` merges the new state with the existing state, allowing for updates.

### Object.freeze():

Called on the Singleton class to prevent any future modifications, ensuring the integrity and immutability of the Singleton instance.

## Usage within a React Native Component

The `SingletonDemo` component demonstrates how to interact with the Singleton class to manage shared state within a React Native application.

### Key Components of `SingletonDemo`:

#### Constructor:

Accesses the Singleton instance using `MySingleton.getInstance()` and stores it in the component's state. This provides a way to interact with the shared state managed by the Singleton.

#### `updateSingletonState` Method:

A method defined to update the state of the Singleton. It demonstrates how to modify shared state across the application through the Singleton instance.

#### `renderSingletonState` Method:

This method retrieves the current state from the Singleton and renders it. It illustrates how to access shared state from the Singleton and display it within a component.

#### Render Method:

Defines the UI of the component, displaying the current state stored in the Singleton and providing a button to trigger a state update. This showcases the Singleton's role in facilitating shared state management across different parts of the application.
