# React-native

React Native is a framework developed by Facebook. It helps make mobile apps that work well on iPhones and Android phones. This makes it easy to create apps that perform and look like they're meant for each device. React Native lets developers reuse code across different projects and see changes instantly while they're working. It's popular because it has a big community of users who share helpful tools and tips, making it a top pick for building mobile apps quickly and effectively.

# Why to use for singleton pattern

Using React Native for a singleton, which is a design pattern where only one instance of a class exists in an application, is beneficial because React Native allows you to write code once and use it on both iOS and Android devices. It also makes development faster by letting you reuse code components. Additionally, React Native apps perform well and benefit from a supportive community and tools for easier implementation and management of singleton pattern.

# Example

## Display a text message using react-native

import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const SimpleComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default SimpleComponent;


## React-native using props component


import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const Greeting = (props) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, {props.name}!</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default Greeting;
