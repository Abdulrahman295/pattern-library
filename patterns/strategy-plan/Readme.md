In the issues section, I was looking for something familiar on which I have worked already. So in those limitation there were sevral options which includes PHP langauge, Java script Language, C#, MVC and any documentation related. But most of them were already assigned and after some time somebody opened this issue #67 which was with java script that is why particularly I chose this one.

Here, I am explaining the flow of the example code.

# Authentication and Authorization Strategies

This project demonstrates the implementation of different authentication and authorization strategies using the Strategy design pattern.

## Authentication Strategies

The `example.js` file defines two authentication strategies:

1. **Basic Authentication Strategy**:
   - The `basicAuthStrategy` object has an `authenticate` function that checks if the provided username and password match the predefined credentials.
   - The `AuthenticationContext` class is used to manage the authentication strategy and provide the `authenticate` method.

2. **OAuth Authentication Strategy**:
   - The `oauthStrategy` object has an `authenticate` function that checks if the provided token is valid.
   - The `AuthenticationContext` class is used to manage the authentication strategy and provide the `authenticate` method.

## Authorization Strategies

The `example.js` file also defines two authorization strategies:

1. **Role-based Authorization Strategy**:
   - The `roleBasedAuthorizationStrategy` object has an `authorize` function that checks if the user's role matches the specified role.
   - The `AuthorizationContext` class is used to manage the authorization strategy and provide the `authorize` method.

2. **Permission-based Authorization Strategy**:
   - The `permissionBasedAuthorizationStrategy` object has an `authorize` function that checks if the user has the specified permission.
   - The `AuthorizationContext` class is used to manage the authorization strategy and provide the `authorize` method.

## Usage Examples

The `example.js` file provides the following usage examples:

1. **Authentication**:
   - An instance of `AuthenticationContext` is created with the `basicAuthStrategy`.
   - The `authenticate` method is called with valid credentials, and the result is logged to the console.
   - The authentication strategy is then switched to `oauthStrategy`, and the `authenticate` method is called with a valid token.

2. **Authorization**:
   - An instance of `AuthorizationContext` is created with the `roleBasedAuthorizationStrategy`.
   - The `authorize` method is called with a user object and different roles, and the results are logged to the console.
   - The authorization strategy is then switched to `permissionBasedAuthorizationStrategy`, and the `authorize` method is called with a user object and different permissions.

This example demonstrates how the Strategy design pattern can be used to implement flexible and extensible authentication and authorization mechanisms in your application.
